This script gets all members in your organization and add they to the one group.
This is very usable when you have private repositories, but you want to share it between all your organization members.
You can run this script automatically - new organization members  will be added to the selected group.

Need to specify only three variables:
Org - the name of your GitHub organization.
Team_id - team id where you want to add all yours members.
Token - Security token with with rights read members and adding them to the group.
